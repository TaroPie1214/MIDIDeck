# MIDIDeck

Use your midi keyboard as a stream deck

# How to build

1. You need to configure the JUCE environment. You can get JUCE at this link: [Download - JUCE](https://juce.com/download/)

2. If you are very confused about the first step, I also have an introductory tutorial for JUCE that you can refer to: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14Q4y1c79d

3. Of course, you can also download the latest compiled .exe file directly from the Release page.

# How to use

Make sure you have selected your MIDI keyboard in *Audio/MIDI Settings*.
